### Aim :
To design a PCB for CookTop and create an application which would enable us to operate our CookTop through phone.
### Introduction :
Induction cooktops generate electromagnetic energy that interacts directly with compatible cookware, turning pots and pans into their own heat source. Because the heat doesn't have to transfer through the cooking surface, induction cooktops can provide fast cooking, optimal temperature control and easy cleaning due to the fact that the glass top surrounding the element stays cool.Cooking on an induction stovetop beats an electric stovetop for efficiency by about 40 percent.

### Description : 
Intially, we started with the basics of Electromagnetic Theory and learnt the principles used in Induction CookTop.The induction stove works on the principle of electromagnetism, which is a new thermal energy technique.When the high-frequency alternating current goes to the coil, it will generate a certain range of magnetic fields. This magnetic field range can generally reach the top of the glass-ceramic within 3cm height. The internal molecules of the bottom of the pot or pan rub intensely through the induction of the magnetic field so that the vessel itself generates thermal energy.It reduces the wastage of heat energy, thereby keeping the kitchen cool.As for the range of temperature, the induction cooker has a wide variation, and the boiling time is far lesser than that of the electric stove or the gas stove.

 When we got familiarized with the project we had discussions on the requirements and constrution of PCB.As all the things around us are being digitalized , we thought to connect our cooktop to our smartphones.So, we learnt about flutter and exchanged our ideas about the features which should be inculded in the app controlling the cooktop.Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android , iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia and the web from a single codebase.While writing and debugging an application,flutter runs in the Dart virtual machine.The central idea is that we build our UI out of widgets. Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current configuration and state. When a widgetâ€™s state changes, the widget rebuilds its description.
 
Then each one of us in our team made a rough sketch of printed circuit board design. And finalized the best one out of those.Finally, we improvised the pcb design and built it on easyeda platform and generated a gerber file of it.

### Conclusion :
The purpose of this project is to learn academic stuff and put it into real life application.We also learnt how to maintain harmony in our team when there were conflicts.Our team has learnt the basics of PCB and Flutter. We even developed our own strategies to manage the time and submit the given tasks within the deadlines.
