### Aim : To design a PCB for CookTop and create an application which would enable us to operate our CookTop through phone.
### Introduction:
      - Induction cooktops generate electromagnetic energy that interacts directly with compatible cookware, turning pots and pans into their own heat source. Because the heat doesn't have to transfer through the cooking surface, induction cooktops can provide fast cooking, optimal temperature control and easy cleaning due to the fact that the glass top surrounding the element stays cool.Cooking on an induction stovetop beats an electric stovetop for efficiency by about 40 percent.
